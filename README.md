Downloadable links:
<a href="datafile_01.txt" download> datafile01 </a>


## Steps:

1. login to github
2. make a new repository with the following name: ```your_username.github.io``` (e.g., for me it's ```sterlingym.github.io```
3. check "add a README file", and then create repository
4. upload all files you want to distribute (e.g., ```datafile_01.txt```)
5. Add the following line ```<a href="YOUR_FILENAME" download> YOUR_FILENAME </a>``` in ```README.md```. You can edit ```README.md``` directly on the github website by clicking the pencil icon. For the example above, I have ```<a href="datafile_01.txt" download> datafile01 </a>```
6. Press "Commit changes" button. Now go to ```your_username.github.io``` and you should see the page with downloadable links to your files!
